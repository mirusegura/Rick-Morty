# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

To start the application, you need to run the following commands: 

    $ npm install 
    $ npm run dev. 

After that, the console will provide you with the URL where you should go to view the project in the browser.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
